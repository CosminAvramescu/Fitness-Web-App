	There are 2 types of users (trainer and trainee). A trainer can register on the platform on the basis of a certificate proving that he has a trainer's licence. Trainers can post workouts and nutrition plans, and trainees can take these workouts and subscribe to trainers.

	The idea is to bring all trainers together in one place, like a social network, where everyone posts their workouts and each trainee can choose what suits them. The trainer also gives the address of the gyms where they work and where they could meet the trainees for live training sessions.
